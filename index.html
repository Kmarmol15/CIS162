<p>On March 13, 2020, "X" Hospital reported a suspected confirmed case of of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). The patient was immediatelly isolated and discharged after evaluation. March 13 is the day that everything turned upside down within our facilty. Rumors begin to spread that we had the first Covid-19 case, some believed it and others didnt.
  Yet, we could of never spected what was ahead for each of us. Within three days our entire work life changed, in person meetings were complete suspended until further notice, cafeterias dining areas were complete shut down, masks started to be mandatory, a goggles policy took place for all clinical and non-clinical staff.
 A hospital that was once very cheerful and hopeful became depressing with empty halways and empty lounge areas.
